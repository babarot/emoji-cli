`emoji-cli` provides input completion for emoji on the command line with an interactive filter.

## :memo: Description

Emoji (çµµæ–‡å­—, Japanese pronunciation: [emodÊ‘i]) are the ideograms or smileys used in Japanese electronic messages and Web pages, that are spreading outside Japan (ref: [Katy Perry - Roar (Lyric Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9SeJIgWRPk)).

Emoji are funny and make us want to use it :blush:. However, it is hard to use it on the command line. This is because the command line don't have input completion for emoji. Therefore, I developed this command line application `emoji-cli`.

***DEMO:***

## :wrench: Setup

### `EMOJI_CLI_DICT`

It is defaults to `./dict/emoji.json`. `EMOJI_CLI_DICT` is a path to dictionary of emoji database file. It is written in JSON.

### `EMOJI_CLI_FILTER`

It is defaults to `fzf-tmux -d 15%:fzf:peco:percol`. `EMOJI_CLI_FILTER` is the interactive filter command in order to use select emoji. It is separated by colon like the `PATH` environment variable.

### `EMOJI_CLI_KEYBIND`

It is defaults to `^s` (ctrl-s). `EMOJI_CLI_KEYBIND` is the key binding to start the input completion for emoji.

### `EMOJI_CLI_USE_EMOJI`

Set this variable to non-null to have the widget return the actual emoji
